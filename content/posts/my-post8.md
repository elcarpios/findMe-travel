## Why did I re-do my website with Nuxt?

Although some of you already know me, I am [Marina Aísa](https://twitter.com/MarinaAisa), UX Engineer (design and front-end) and I currently work at [Holaluz](https://www.holaluz.com/en).

Last year, 2018, I was very focused on learning more about JavaScript, which was a pending subject and at the same time I learnt [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Meanwhile at my workplace, we started using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) a framework on VueJS to remake both company's static and dynamic (SPA) webapps into components and create a design system with it.

My previous website was made with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) a static pages generator based on Ruby, so I took the opportunity to redo my website with Nuxt and Vue, in order to:
- To learn
- Improve performance
- Add functionality as a blog and portfolio system
- Add two languages, Spanish and English, **also in blog posts** but independently, since I guess I won't translate every post in both languages.

What attracts me the most of Nuxt is the philosophy *serverless* (Nuxt can also be SSR tho) and the static prerendering it provides to SPA applications. Briefly, with this stack you can combine the best of a static website: compiled HTML -> what leads to a better SEO, plus the best of a *single page application*: Webpack, cache optimizations, lazy-loading, functions and asynchronous data...
